# Summary

... The Sindhi language Universal Dependency Treebank was automatically converted from Sindhi Dependency Treebank (SDTB) which is part of an ongoing effort of creating multi-layered treebanks for Sindhi....

# Introduction

Sindhi is the oldest, indegenous and most widely-spoken language of the Indo-Aryan language group. It is spoken mainly in Sindh Pakistan and India by Sindhi people. Development of the Sindhi Reference Corpus (mention URL) was started in Mention year (Reference). The corpus includes a non-disambiguated sub-corpus and a disambiguated one. For a current moment, the whole corpus contains about --- tokens. of these, around ---- million are L1 speakers. Development of Sindhi text corpus (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319157818311649) was started in year 2016 (Reference: Dootio, Mazhar Ali, and Asim Imdad Wagan. "Development of Sindhi text corpus." Journal of King Saud University-Computer and Information Sciences (2019)). The corpus was annotated using UD Annotatrix annotation tool (https://sindhinlp.com/).
